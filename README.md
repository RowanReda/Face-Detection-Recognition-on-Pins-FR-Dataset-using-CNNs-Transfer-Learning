Hereâ€™s a README outline for each of the provided notebooks to clarify the purpose, processes, and outputs:

---

### `face_detection_cropped_dataset.ipynb`

**Purpose:**  
This notebook detects faces in a large dataset of celebrity images, crops each detected face, and organizes them into a new folder structure. This is the first step in creating a cleaned dataset of consistent face images for later processing.

**Main Processes:**
1. **Face Detection and Visualization:** Uses the MTCNN model to detect faces in each image and draws bounding boxes around detected faces.
2. **Face Cropping and Saving:** Crops each detected face and resizes it to 224x224 pixels. Saves these cropped images in a new folder structure under a `cropped` directory, with subdirectories for each celebrity.

**Outputs:**
- **Cropped Face Dataset:** Organized in a folder structure where each celebrity's images are saved in separate folders.
- **Log of Images without Faces:** Lists paths to images where no faces were detected.

### `npALLDataa.ipynb`

**Purpose:**  
This notebook loads each cropped face image, preprocesses it, and saves it as a .npy file to streamline data loading in subsequent notebooks.

**Main Processes:**
1. **Image and Label Loading:** Loads all images from the `cropped` dataset, resizes them to 224x224 pixels, and applies preprocessing.
2. **Label Mapping:** Maps each image to its respective celebrity label for identification.
3. **Data Storage:** Saves the processed images and corresponding labels as .npy files for efficient model training and evaluation.

**Outputs:**
- **all_images.npy:** Contains preprocessed image data for each cropped face.
- **all_labels.npy:** Holds integer labels corresponding to each image.
- **label_mapping.npy:** Maps integer labels to celebrity names for future use.

### `FaceNetEmbbedder.ipynb`

**Purpose:**  
This notebook generates face embeddings for each cropped image using a pre-trained FaceNet model. The embeddings represent each face as a feature vector, capturing unique characteristics for classification or clustering tasks.

**Main Processes:**
1. **Embedding Extraction:** Uses FaceNet to compute a 128-dimensional embedding for each face.
2. **Embedding Storage:** Saves embeddings to a .npy file for use in training models or as inputs to other classification and clustering algorithms.

**Outputs:**
- **face_embeddings.npy:** Contains 128-dimensional embeddings for each face image, generated by FaceNet.

### `liveCamera.ipynb`

**Purpose:**  
This notebook captures live video from the camera, detects faces in real-time, and classifies detected faces based on precomputed average embeddings, identifying if they belong to a known celebrity.

**Main Processes:**
1. **Real-time Face Detection:** Detects faces from the live camera feed.
2. **Face Embedding and Classification:** Computes embeddings for detected faces and compares them with saved average embeddings to classify them into known categories.
3. **Unknown Face Handling:** Labels unrecognized faces as unidentified.

**Outputs:**
- **Real-time Classification Output:** Displays each detected face with its classification result on the live video feed.

### `inception80%.ipynb`

**Purpose:**  
This notebook trains a deep learning model (using Inception architecture) for classifying celebrity faces. It uses the previously generated embeddings or images and fine-tunes a model to reach an accuracy of 80%.

**Main Processes:**
1. **Model Training:** Trains an Inception model with a dataset of celebrity face images and their embeddings.
2. **Model Evaluation:** Monitors and evaluates the model's performance, optimizing for a target accuracy of 80%.

**Outputs:**
- **Trained Model (inception80%.h5):** Saved model weights for use in downstream tasks such as embedding calculation or real-time classification.

### `MMO1.ipynb`

**Purpose:**  
This notebook contains initial model development and experimentation, potentially testing multiple model options or architectures for classification of the celebrity face dataset. This includes pre-processing and potential baseline model comparisons.

**Main Processes:**
1. **Model Testing and Experimentation:** Explores various model architectures, hyperparameters, or pre-processing techniques.
2. **Performance Evaluation:** Provides insights on each model's effectiveness, establishing baselines for the face classification task.

**Outputs:**
- **Baseline Results:** Experimental results from initial models or architectures, potentially saved as plots or metrics within the notebook for comparison.
